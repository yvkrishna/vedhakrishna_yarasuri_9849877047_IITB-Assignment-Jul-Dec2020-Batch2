## Day - 1
<ul><li>Studied suggested research paper titled "Attention-based Extraction of Structured
Information from Street View Imagery
"and learnt about attention models at coursera sequence models.</li>
<li>Searched for various articles about the creation of OCR systems.</li>
</ul>

## Day - 2
<ul><li>Referred various datasets for the training of the model.But Found very difficult in getting the data.</li>
<li>created a colab notebook and imported pre-trained inception_resnet_v2 trained on imagenet dataset for feature extraction.</li>
<li>studied attention models to concatinate with the feature maps obtained from inception_resnet_v2 model.</li></ul>
